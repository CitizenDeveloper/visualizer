      <h3>SCENARIO</h3>
      <p>
      </p>
      <div class="example"></div>
      <p class="center"><em>Here's a word cloud of this page</em></p>
      <p>
        The latest market research science tells us that if we want to really connect with our customers we should use the same language that they use.  In preparation for an upcoming marketing campaign, the Director of Marketing suggests we review our online presence to confirm that we're using language that resonates with our community.
      </p>
      <p>
        This challenge invites you to reshape the data exported so it can be rendered as a word cloud. Once you have that diagram you'll better understand what language to use when conversing with your customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Good luck!

      <h3>DESIRED OUTPUT</h3>
      <p>
        The word cloud that you've chosen requires data encoded as an array, or
        list, of JSON objects, or dictionaries, each with the value of the word
        and the frequency of the words occurrence.  The final output of which, will
        look something like this:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
[{word: "this", count: 24}, {word: "bananas", count: 18}, ...]
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        Thankfully, our talented developers are willing to take this transformation
        that last mile for us.  They're even willing to remove punctuation.  All
        they ask is that we take the paragraph of text we want parsed, and turn
        it into an array:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
["this", "is", "an", "example", ...]
      </code></pre>
