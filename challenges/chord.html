      <h3>SCENARIO</h3>
      <p>
        Recently, one of our APIs suffered a service outage.  Several customers
        were very upset, and requested that the next time an outage occurs, that
        they are notified right away.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given the sheer number of services you offer, and the number of customers
        you have, you have decided to create a visualization that displays both
        the customers dependent on a given service and weighs how dependent they
        are on that service.  That way, given another crisis, you are able to
        contact everyone using the service starting with those that depend on it
        most heavily first.
      </p>
      <p>
        A chord diagram/dependency wheel uses connection strength between entities to draw related entities closer in a visualization. To generate a chord diagram among services you offer, you request a report from your product managers. Unfortunately, the data isn't in the right shape for the chord diagram.
      </p>
      <div class="example"></div>
      <p class="center"><em>Example chord diagram</em></p>
      <p>
        This challenge invites you to reshape the data exported so it can be rendered as a chord diagram. Once you have that diagram you'll know which customers depend on your services the most.
      </p>
      <p>
        Good luck!

      <h3>DESIRED OUTPUT</h3>
      <p>
        The chord diagram that you've chosen requires data encoded as a matrix.
        Imagine groups along the top and bottom of the matrix, and the strength of
        their relationships at the intersections.
      </p>
      <pre><code>
  A B C D
A 0 0 1 1
B 0 0 0 1
C 1 0 0 0
D 1 1 0 0
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        Our program will accept a list of smaller lists, where each smaller list
        is a row of the matrix:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
[
  [0,0,1,1],
  [0,0,0,1],
  [1,0,0,0],
  [1,1,0,0],
  ...
]
      </code></pre>
